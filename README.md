# **Code Quiz** - [![License: WTFPL](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-WTFPL-brightgreen.svg)](http://www.wtfpl.net/about/)
    
Code Quiz is a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. The app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It has a clean, polished, and responsive user interface driven by Bootstrap and customized further by me.
