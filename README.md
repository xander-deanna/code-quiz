code-quiz - Homework assignment for 01/20/2021

---------------------------------------------------------

This week's assignment was to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores.

I started by building the bare bones of my site using HTML and javaScript. I also through in some HTML elements to help me visualize formatting, although many would be deleted later and created dynamically through javaScript. 

After the HTML and CSS was complete, I started working on the javaScript. I started first with my timer. I tied the timer to a navbar element and made sure that it was displaying correctly. I also had the timer display the text "Times up!" once the time had reached 0.

After I was happy with my timer I went ahead and started thinking of quiz questions. I decided the easiest way to go about this in my opinion, would be to create an array of objects.

This is where I have currently become stuck, although I hoping to receive some assistance from a tutor and get the app up and running very soon. Please feel free to grade accordingly. I'll re-submit once finished!
